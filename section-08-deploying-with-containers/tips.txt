We are located in section 8 folder:
> Dockerfile -> filer with configuration for docker image
FROM python:3.11
    Specify the Base Image
    Purpose: Sets the base image to Python 3.11, ensuring that Python and pip are pre-installed in the Docker environment.
# Create the user that will run the app
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' ml-api-user
    Create a Non-Root User
    Purpose: Adds a new user named ml-api-user without a password and with empty GECOS fields.
    Why?: Running applications as a non-root user enhances security by limiting permissions.
WORKDIR /opt/house-prices-api
    Set the Working Directory
    Purpose: Sets /opt/house-prices-api as the working directory for subsequent commands.
    Why?: Organizes the application files in a specific directory within the container.
ARG PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL
    Declare Build-Time Argument
    Purpose: Declares a build-time variable PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL.
    Why?: Used to pass an extra index URL to pip for installing packages from private repositories like Gemfury.
# Install requirements, including from Gemfury
ADD ./house-prices-api /opt/house-prices-api/
    Copy Application Files
    Purpose: Copies the house-prices-api directory from your local machine into the Docker image at /opt/house-prices-api/.
    Why?: Includes your application code and dependencies in the Docker image.
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
    Upgrade pip
    Purpose: Upgrades pip to the latest version.
    Why?: Ensures compatibility with the latest packages and features.
RUN pip install -r /opt/house-prices-api/requirements.txt
    Install Python Dependencies
    Purpose: Installs all Python packages listed in requirements.txt.
    Why?: Sets up the Python environment with all necessary dependencies for your application.
RUN chmod +x /opt/house-prices-api/run.sh
RUN chown -R ml-api-user:ml-api-user ./
    Modify Permissions and Ownership
    Purpose:
    chmod +x: Makes the run.sh script executable.
    chown -R: Changes the ownership of all files in the current directory to ml-api-user.
    Why?: Ensures that the non-root user has the necessary permissions to execute scripts and access files.
USER ml-api-user
    Switch to Non-Root User
    Purpose: Sets the default user for the container to ml-api-user.
    Why?: Continues the practice of running the application as a non-root user for security reasons.
EXPOSE 8001
    Expose the Application Port
    Purpose: Informs Docker that the container will listen on port 8001 at runtime.
    Why?: Allows you to map this port to the host machine when running the container.

1. Having Dockerfile we can move on with creation of docker image
- docker build -t house-prices-api-image .
OR below if we have to pass arguments like PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL
- docker build --build-arg PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://7ixWSxPusbbwzjdA5MZn:@pypi.fury.io/zheka204 -t house-prices-api:latest .
2. Image is like a class in OOP, and container is like and object, so to use Docker we need to create a container from image
- docker run -p 8001:8001 -e PORT=8001 house-prices-api
3. Then enter in browser http://127.0.0.1:8001/ this will lead u to ur application running via Docker







house-price-api:
> requirements.txt
there is a line like --extra-index-url=${PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL}
    Purpose: This line instructs pip to use an additional package index when searching for packages to install.
    ${PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL}: This is an environment variable that should contain the URL of a custom or private package
    repository (e.g., Gemfury).
    Function: By specifying --extra-index-url, pip will search both the default Python Package Index (PyPI)
    and the additional index URL for packages. This is essential when your project depends on packages that are
    not available on PyPI.
tid-regression-model==4.0.5
    Searching for Packages:
    When you run pip install -r requirements.txt, pip reads the list of packages and attempts to install them.
    Pip searches for each package in the order of the indexes specified. By default, it searches PyPI first, then any extra indexes provided via --extra-index-url.
    Package Not on PyPI:
    The tid-regression-model==4.0.5 package is not available on PyPI.
    Pip attempts to find tid-regression-model on PyPI but fails because it doesn't exist there.
    Package Found on Gemfury:
    After failing to find the package on PyPI, pip proceeds to search the extra index URL provided, which points to Gemfury.
    Pip finds tid-regression-model==4.0.5 on Gemfury and installs it from there.
